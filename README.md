# Top Trumps Game

Welcome to the Top Trumps Game! This project has been developed by Gavin and Jake as a way to keep their coding skills sharp while searching for their first roles in tech after recently completing the School of Code bootcamp. We aimed to manage this project professionally and employed a DevOps pipeline to continuously iterate and improve.

## How to Play

In this iteration of the game, you will be playing against the computer.

You will be shown your first card.
Pick one of the stats on your card.
This stat will be compared to the same stat on the computer's first card.
If your stat is higher, you win both cards.
If your stat is lower or equal, the computer wins both cards.
Repeat steps 1-3 until one player has all the cards.
The player left with all the cards is the winner.
